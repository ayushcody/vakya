-- 008_receipts.sql: signed provenance receipts, one per generation and per agent reply (see services/provenance.py).
-- Idempotent. Written by the backend with the service-role key; the public /api/verify endpoint reads them through
-- the backend too, so there is no anonymous access to this table. RLS lets signed-in users read only their own.
-- Deliberately no foreign keys to voices, generations or conversation_turns: a receipt must outlive the thing it
-- describes (deleting a voice or a clip never erases the record that it was synthetic).
