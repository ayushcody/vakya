"""The prompt prefix a language model can reuse across the turns of one agent (a hosted model can cache a prompt by its exact start):
the system message is byte-identical from turn to turn, and everything that differs per turn (the question, the clock,
the retrieved passages, the key facts, the reply language of the turn, the caller's details) is in the final user
message. Built with the real assembly (backend.turn_messages, services.tools.prepare_messages); the clock, the fact
sheet and the passages are fixed here."""
