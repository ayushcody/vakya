"""First clause, not first sentence (services/sentences.py, TURN_FIRST_CLAUSE=on, the default): the first piece of a
reply goes to the voice at the first comma, semicolon, colon or dash once 4 words are in, or at the conjunction / 8th
word when there is none. English, Hindi (Devanagari) and Hinglish; numbers, times, abbreviations and URLs are never
cut; the result does not depend on how the text was chopped into streamed deltas; later pieces are plain sentences."""
