"""A booking spoken over many turns: the agent must not ask again for what the caller already said.

The scripted model is a perfect receptionist that knows only what is in the messages it is sent: it asks for the
name, then the number, then the day and time, skipping whatever already appears in a caller message, and books through
the tool once it has all four. Before the fix the model saw only the last six rows of the conversation, so a caller who
asked a question or two first (or gave the number in pieces) had the name scroll out and was asked for it again."""
