"""When did a conversation last use this machine? Background jobs (services/background_llm.py) ask before they load a
model, so they never compete with a caller.

`mark_turn()` is called at the start of every conversation turn (app, web call, phone: backend.turn_begin).
`is_idle(quiet_s)` is true when no turn started in the last `quiet_s` seconds and no phone call is live. It looks at the
turns of this process, so it costs no database read.

Listeners registered with `on_turn()` are told about every turn (the background model unloads itself); they run on the
caller's thread, so they must return at once.
