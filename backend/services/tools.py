"""Tools for voice agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Vakya is an MCP client: an agent lists MCP servers by name in its `tools` setting, this module starts each server as
a stdio subprocess (once, kept warm, shut down with the API), lists the server's tools and calls them. `run_tool_turn()`
is the loop a spoken turn uses: it shows the model the tool schemas, executes the calls the model asks for (at most
MAX_TOOL_CALLS per turn) and returns the final answer together with a record of what was done.

How the model asks for a tool (VAKYA_TOOL_PROTOCOL):
- json (the default): the prompt lists the tools and the model answers either with plain text or with one JSON object
  {"tool": name, "arguments": {...}}, parsed with llm.extract_json. It works with every OpenAI-compatible endpoint, whatever
  its tool-calling support.
- native: OpenAI-style `tools` / `tool_calls` (Embeddings's OpenAI-compatible endpoint takes them with tool_choice "auto";
  see services/embeddings.py), for models that call tools dependably. If no provider can, or the native exchange fails, the turn continues with the JSON
  protocol, replaying (never repeating) the calls already made.

Safety: tools exist only for agents that enabled them; arguments are checked against the tool's JSON schema here and
validated again by the server; tool results are handed to the model as data, never as instructions; a destructive
tool (CONFIRM_BEFORE) only runs when the previous agent turn already asked the caller about exactly that item; a tool
that commits something new (READBACK_TOOLS: a booking) first answers NOT DONE with the resolved
details in one sentence, which the model reads back with "Shall I book it?", and runs on the next call once that
read-back and a question are in the previous agent turn (TOOLS_READBACK=off restores one-step writes); dates and
times in the caller's words are resolved in code before any check (services/when.py); details already given in the
conversation (the caller details form of services/caller_memory.py and known_slots, from earlier tool calls) are listed in
the caller's message so they are never asked again;
and a booking id the model says aloud that no tool returned, or a claim that something was booked, requested or
cancelled on a day or at a time while no write tool succeeded (claims_unconfirmed_write), is replaced by a safe line
(UNCONFIRMED_LINE).

Server configuration: "appointments" is built in (backend/mcp_servers/appointments.py: the doctor list), and so is
"schedules" (services/schedule_tools.py: check_availability, list_free_slots, book, reschedule, cancel on the front desk's own
schedules, run in this process). More servers can be added in
backend/data/mcp/servers.json (or the file named by VAKYA_MCP_SERVERS), as
{"name": {"label": "...", "command": "python", "args": ["server.py"], "env": {...}, "cwd": "/path"}}.
