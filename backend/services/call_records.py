"""Phone call records: one row per call, kept across restarts (data/call_records.jsonl, newest row of a call wins).

A row says what happened to a call (queued, ringing, in-progress, completed, failed, busy, no-answer, canceled), which
agent and owner it belongs to, its direction, when it started and ended, how it ended and which conversation holds its
transcript. The callee's number is stored masked only (the same privacy default as the Calls page);
anything that needs real numbers keeps them in its own table, not here.

The log is append-only and tolerant: a torn last line is skipped, and a call that appears only in the callback (a
restart lost the in-memory register) is still recorded."""
