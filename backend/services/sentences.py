"""Split streamed text into speakable sentences as the text arrives.

A sentence ends at . ? ! … or the Devanagari danda ।, plus any closing quote or bracket, when whitespace follows (so
decimals such as 4.5 and times such as 10.30 stay whole), or at a newline. A full stop after an abbreviation (Dr.,
Mr., a.m., p.m., e.g., i.e., etc.), an initial (A. Kulkarni) or a list number (1.) does not end one. A sentence that
runs past MAX_CHARS without any of these is cut at its last comma, semicolon or colon so speech can still start.

`turn_splitter()` is the splitter of a spoken turn. The time to speak a piece grows with its length, so shorter pieces reach the caller sooner: pieces are capped at TURN_MAX_CHARS (110) at phrase
boundaries, and the first piece is a short clause (see `first_phrase`) instead of a whole sentence: it is cut at the
first comma, semicolon, colon or dash once 4 words have arrived, at a conjunction or the 8th word when none came
(TURN_FIRST_CLAUSE=off restores the older rule, a cut only after 8 words have arrived).

        for sentence in sp.feed(delta):
